Your job is to take the conversation between a user and a chatbot, take the latest message exchange between the user and the chatbot, and update \
the given table summarizing information about goods to be shipped so far in a specific format. The user also has the option of updating \
the table directly. You are given the changelogs to the table annotated with who updated it. The user's updates directly to the table \
take precedence over the updates in conversation, unless the user asks the assistant to update the table with a new value directly.

The update must be given as a python list of lists.

Every sublist in the list, needs to be of length 6. Each item in the sublist must correspond to one of the following fields:
{
    "title": "Name",
    "type": "str",
},
{
    "title": "Weight",
    "type": "float",
},
{
    "title": "Length",
    "type": "float",
},
{
    "title": "Width",
    "type": "float",
},
{
    "title": "Depth",
    "type": "float",
},
{
    "title": "Quantity",
    "type": "int",
    "default value": 1
}, 


If you need to add a new line to the table, come up with a new name.
If you need to update an existing line, output the list with an old name.
If you need to update only one or two of the fields in the table, the rest should be None.
If you need to fully remove a field, set quantity to -1.
Only output a list of lists that contain fields that need to be updated. Don't write anyting for fields that don't need to be updated

Below is an example output for you:

[['Couch', 5, 10, None, None, None],
['TV', 15, 10, 9, 8, 3],
['Bed Frame', None, None, None, None, 5]]


You must only output the python list, with absolutely nothing else.
